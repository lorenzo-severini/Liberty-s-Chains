# Liberty-s-Chains

## Project Overview
**Liberty's Chains** is an action roguelike game with **souls-like combat mechanics**, drawing inspiration from titles such as *Dark Souls*, *Elden Ring*, and *Hades*. The game features a **top-down perspective**, emphasizing strategic combat where players must carefully time attacks and defensive maneuvers.

The game is developed for **PC** and is playable exclusively via keyboard controls. The target audience includes gamers who enjoy **challenging combat-focused roguelikes** with pixel-art aesthetics. The game is rated **PEGI 12** due to its combat-oriented mechanics.

This project was developed as a learning experience to understand the fundamentals of **video game development**, including **game design, programming, and artistic direction**. The goal was to explore key aspects of game creation while building a functional and engaging game.

## Concept & Story

The only path to freedom is through a series of brutal combat encounters against increasingly formidable enemies, culminating in a final battle against Rome’s champions. The game’s story unfolds through an engaging narrative that immerses the player in **a world of oppression, survival, and revenge**.
