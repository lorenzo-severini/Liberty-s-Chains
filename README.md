# Liberty-s-Chains

## Project Overview
**Liberty's Chains** is an action roguelike game with **souls-like combat mechanics**, drawing inspiration from titles such as *Dark Souls*, *Elden Ring*, and *Hades*. The game features a **top-down perspective**, emphasizing strategic combat where players must carefully time attacks and defensive maneuvers.

The game is developed for **PC** and is playable exclusively via keyboard controls. The target audience includes gamers who enjoy **challenging combat-focused roguelikes** with pixel-art aesthetics. The game is rated **PEGI 12** due to its combat-oriented mechanics.
